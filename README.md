# Open-GUI-ETL

A lightweight, open-source ETL pipeline designer with a graphical user interface – powered by Python.

This project includes a graphical pipeline builder to make it easy to create and manage ETL pipelines.

It automatically generates a run.py file, prefilled with detailed comments to help you configure it step-by-step.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/I-lander/open-gui-etl.git
   cd light-etl
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install Poetry via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the official installer script:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
   poetry install --no-root
   poetry run pip install -e .
   ```

## Using the Pipeline GUI Builder

1. **Launch the GUI**:

   ```bash
   poetry run python pipeline_gui_builder/main.py
   ```

2. **Create the pipeline**:
   - To create your pipeline, simply select the blocks you want to use and arrange them in the desired order.
   - If you want the tool to automatically create the necessary folders and a .env file for local execution, check the "Generate Local Files" option.
   - Once your pipeline is ready, click the Generate Script button and choose where to save the run.py file. Make sure to save it inside a folder under the jobs directory.
   - ⚠️ It is important to respect this folder structure so that the script can properly find and use its dependencies.
   - After that, you can run your script with the following command:
   ```bash
   poetry run python jobs/<your_folder>/run.py
   ```

## Code Style

This project uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) as the code formatter.

To ensure consistent formatting, run the following command before committing:

```bash
poetry run black .
```

If you're using VS Code, you can install the Black extension and set it as your default formatter for Python files.

## Features

- Visual pipeline builder with drag-and-drop blocks
- Generates a fully-documented Python ETL script (`run.py`)
- Automatically sets up folders and local environment
- Built entirely with Python
- Ideal for replacing or prototyping Talend-style workflows

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure designed for clarity and ease of use:

### `jobs/`

All your ETL pipelines must be created in this folder.  
Each job must be placed in its **own subfolder** inside `jobs/`, and must contain a `run.py` file.  
This file is automatically generated by the GUI and serves as the entry point for running the pipeline.

> Example: `jobs/my_first_job/run.py`

### `utils/`

This folder contains **all the reusable Python functions** used across pipelines.  
You will find modules to manage files, logs, cloud storage (S3, Google Drive), RabbitMQ, and more.  
These functions are automatically imported into the generated ETL scripts.
All functions are fully documented with comments.

> You should not need to modify this folder unless you are adding new processing logic.

### `pipeline_gui_builder/`

Contains the graphical interface used to create pipelines visually.  
From here, you can generate `run.py` scripts based on the blocks you select.

## Docker

A Dockerfile is included if you want to build and run the project in a container.
